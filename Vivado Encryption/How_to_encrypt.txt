-- HOW TO ENCRYPT --

1. Verify that encrypt.bat, keyfile_ver.txt and keyfile_vhd.txt are in the same folder
   (if not, or you don't have keyfile_ver.txt and/or keyfile_vhd.txt the batch will ask 
   permission to create default ones)
   `
2. Launch encrypt.bat <namefile.zip>, and a <namefile_encrypted.zip> file will be created
